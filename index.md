Karan Gupta
“As a professional career consultant I believe passionately that self-knowledge is your most powerful tool when developing your potential and planning your career journey. However the best counselling doesn’t just involve aptitude tests, profiles and scores - it also requires working one-to-one to really understand your ambitions, your real strengths and your passions. The best career guidance comes from a mentoring approach, and over the last two decades I’ve been able to help high school students, graduates, career changers and senior executives to maximise their potential.” 

Karan Gupta is also available for face-to-face or online coaching for those looking for advice and guidance on other life decisions that often go hand-in-hand with career consulting. A particularly valuable service for students, this can help to understand how making a large personal change like choosing to move abroad to study could impact on future choices and career goals.
